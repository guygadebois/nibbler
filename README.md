# Nibbler

## Authors
This project is a course project done by two students from Ecole 42 (Paris) :  
**Jean-Sebastien Heitz-Schaaf** (jheitz-s@student.42.fr) and **Gilles Lourdelet** (glourdel@student.42.fr).  
It is mainly coded in **C++**, with a bit of **Python** for communication with Myo Armband.

## UML
We've started this project by designing the whole architecture, and representing it with UML.    
Along the development time, we'll update the UML file to describe wich classes have been actually implemented.  
The whole architecture is likely to change. We'll maybe face inconsistencies while trying to implement it.  
But we've tried to plan it as long as we could in order to product a clean and maintanable code.

## Gameplay
Nibbler is an adaptation of the legendary "nibbler" (or "snake") game.  
Anyone old enough to have used a Nokia 3310 knows what I'm talking about!

For the others, nibbler is a game where you control a nibbler (or snake) that keeps growing when it eats.
The goal of the game is to reach the longest nibbler possible without dying.  
Nibbler dies when its head collides with either part of its body or a border of the map.

## Bonus
As a personal bonus, we added the following features :
* A multi-player mode, up to 4 players fighting against each other.
* Possibility to use the Myo Armband (see https://www.thalmic.com/en/myo/) to control player #1.
* Special items to pick up (increase/decrease pace, invert controls, invicibility)
